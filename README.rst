Programming for Scientists
==========================
A course for scientists who write code
--------------------------------------

This was a course offered at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2009. It was
designed and taught by Luis Pedro Coelho (available at luis@luispedro.org), a
graduate student in computational biology.

Materials available
-------------------

This package includes slides (under lectures/slides). These are exactly the
slides that I presented except for a few typos that became apparent during
lecture. It also includes lecture aids which were mostly little pieces of code
that I resorted to during class.

There are a few other documents of interest, in particular, the syllabus.
